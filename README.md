The rapid increase in vehicle traffic and urbanization has created an urgent demand for efficient traffic control systems capable of managing complex transportation networks. This review explores the integration of Intelligent Traffic Analysis Systems (ITAS) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a subset of deep learning technology, to deliver accurate and real-time traffic data analysis. ITAS leverages advanced machine learning techniques to monitor, analyze, and optimize traffic flow, addressing the challenges posed by congestion and inefficiencies in urban transportation systems. At the core of this approach are deep learning models specialized in object detection and tracking, which enable ITAS to identify and monitor vehicles, including cars and trucks, in real-time. By employing transfer learning, pre-trained CNN models are adapted and fine-tuned for traffic analysis tasks, significantly enhancing their accuracy and computational efficiency. These advancements enable effective detection and management of traffic patterns, ultimately mitigating congestion and streamlining transportation systems.
